GPK file is used at muzhiwan website (www.muzhiwan.com) to provide a convenient way to install large games.

Since muzhiwan only provides installer of Windows platform, I write a little script to help you install the gpk file.

Dependencies:
Android SDK for Linux (At least, you need adb tools).
unzip
